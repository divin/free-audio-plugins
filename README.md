# Introduction

A list of various free audio plug-ins (AU / VST) in 64-bit format. I have not tested all of them, but the ones I tested worked in Logic Pro X on macOS with Apple M1 chip. I left out everything that requires additional software, as I prefer no additional software.

For some plugins an account has to be created, maybe you are lucky and can skip this by finding some credentials [here](http://bugmenot.com). For most plugins that require an email address, you can also try some temporary email addresses.

I've added some keywords for each plugin so you can easily search for ... search by pressing `CONTROL + F` or `COMMAND + F` on Windows or macOS respectively.

**Contributions are welcome, you can submit a plugin by [opening an issue.](https://github.com/divin/free-audio-plugins/issues/new/choose)**
